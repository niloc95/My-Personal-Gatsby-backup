I have worked in different roles from Technical to Management, having the pleasure of working with large enterprises such as Standard Bank, Investec, Multichoice(DSTV), Medihelp Medical Scheme, Tracker SA, VOX, Sun International, Southern Sun.\n\nMaking things happen is your business as a programmer. This means that you’ll take care of the technical details, understand what to do, and get it done in a timely fashion. But being a great code writer doesn’t mean that you don’t have to be able to step back and look at the big picture - sometimes it can be difficult! That’s why we want you to work with other people who will provide more insight into the how your program works under the hood in order for us to better understand how our system works in its entirety - which will benefit everyone.\n","budget":{"currency":"R","default":10,"max":100,"min":5},"company":"Freelancing","focus":"Software Engineering","focus_url":"https://frontend.co.za","for_hire":true,"image":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fixed","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/e4c8539b399561c25e5da57468aed219/17fa0/profile.jpg","srcSet":"/static/e4c8539b399561c25e5da57468aed219/17fa0/profile.jpg 144w,\n/static/e4c8539b399561c25e5da57468aed219/d75f5/profile.jpg 288w","sizes":"144px"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/e4c8539b399561c25e5da57468aed219/7512d/profile.webp 144w,\n/static/e4c8539b399561c25e5da57468aed219/654e6/profile.webp 288w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"144px"}]},"width":144,"height":144}},"publicURL":"/static/e4c8539b399561c25e5da57468aed219/profile.jpg"},"initials":"NN","location":"Johannesburg, South Africa","name":"Nilo Cara","profession":"Front-end Software Engineer","relocation":true,"skills":["JavaScript (ES6)","Python","TypeScript","R","PHP","CSS/Sass","GraphQL","HTML/CSS"],"libfra":["jQuery","React","Gatsby","Vue","Node.js","Codeigniter"],"tools":["Webflow","OxygenBuilder","Wordpress","HTML/CSS","WooCommerce","VSCode","Elementor","Amazon Web Services"]},"social":{"nodes":[{"name":"linkedin","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/nilo-cara/"},{"name":"twitter","url":"https://twitter.com/CodeCara"},{"name":"behance","url":"https://www.behance.net/nilocara"},{"name":"github","url":"https://github.com/niloc95"}]},"history":{"nodes":[{"company":"Atomic Studio","period":"January 2018 - present","position":"Senior Web Developer","url":"https://atomic.studio"},{"company":"Atomic Studio","period":"January 2014 - December 2017","position":"Web Developer","url":"https://atomic.studio"},{"company":"WebConnect Agency","period":"November 2010 - December 2013","position":"Junior Web Developer","url":null},{"company":"Freelance","period":"April 2008 - October 2010","position":"Web Developer","url":null}]},"projects":{"nodes":[{"description":"Override the digital divide with additional clickthroughs from DevOps.
